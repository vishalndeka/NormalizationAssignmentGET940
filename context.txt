This database has been designed to emulate ones involved in online fantasy sports tournaments,
such as Dream 11, Euro 2020 fantasy, Fantasy Premier League etc.

I have considered an Indian player-base in this case. Users can select from a set of real life football
players (10 shown here) to make a team. Users can also select 1 real life team of their choice (6
shown here) to be their home team. Users are free to name their club anything they prefer, with no
constraints on its uniqueness.

The users are rewarded with points at the end of a season based on their team selections and real
life match results. For e.g, assume a user ‘vishal' has ‘Ronaldo' in his roster, and has ‘NE' as his home
team. If ‘Ronaldo’ and ‘NE' both perform excellently in the real life season in player and club level
respectively, ‘vishal' gets a high score. Similarly if both underperform, ‘vishal' gets a low score.
Ultimately different player-club combinations are used to obtain season points in the range 0-10 for each player.

The users receive sum of all points scored by each player on his/her team.

For sake of competition, 4 virtual leagues on basis of geography, North, South, East and West have
been created. Users are assigned leagues on the basis of their home team selection, as each real life
team falls under the 4 zones mentioned above.

For sake of simplicity, the database is built from the perspective of the real life player and real life club. A user's points table
can be easily constructed with the knowledge of his/her entire 11-man roster and home team.
